# Purpose of This R Markdown
This is a personal .rmd to help me relearn some concepts and techniques in R. Information is rewritten and paraphrased for my own personal comprehension. Others can follow along if they would like. I do not own any concepts or ideas found in this .rmd.

## Honor to Hadley Wickham
The only reason I'm able to create this document is because of the father and developer of the tidyverse. It's a great privilege to be alive at the same time as such an honorable and knowledgeable figurehead, Hadley Wickham. He has revolutionized data analysis, no longer making us "reinvent the wheel", rather than he took the wheel and kept it in place. All resources from this R Markdown come from Tidy Data (2014).

### What is Tidy Data?

There are three rules to make a tidy dataset.
![There are three rules to make a tidy dataset.](images/tidy-1.png)
1. Each variable has its own column  
2. Each observation has its own row  
3. Each value has its own cell

#### How do we abide by these rules?

I'm first going to recreate a dummy .csv dataset that Wickham used early in his paper. 

```{r}
classroom <- data.frame("name"=c("Billy","Suzy","Lionel","Jenny"),"quiz1"=c(NA,"F","B","A"),"quiz2"=c("D",NA,"C","A"),"test1"=c("C",NA,"B","B"))
                                                  
classroom
```
We will be tidying this data based on the rules above.  

So, the functions I was taught when initially learning the tidyverse were gather() and spread(). However, these functions are no longer updated and in active development, so essentially these are dead functions. Newer functions have come to replace these. pivot_longer() is now equivalent to gather() and pivot_wider() is equivalent to spread(). These functions are great for working with key-value pairs. A key-value pair are variables that are linked together. The key is the identifier and the value is what the identifier can or is equal to. For example, using the classroom dataframe above: name:Billy, name:Suzy, quiz1:F  


According to R Documentation, gather() takes multiple columns and collapses them into key-value pairs. But pivot_longer() essentially increases the number of rows and decreases the number of columns. spread() is used to spread a key-value pair across multiple columns.
